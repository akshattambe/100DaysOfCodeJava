# 100DaysOfCodeJava
Learning Java for 100 Days. Thats untill 31st Dec 2020. We have started this series at Twitter on October 3rd.

Its not about learning all of the Java in 100 days :)

We together are going to look at some common and uncommon concepts of Java and brush it up thoroughly. We will code, ready books/blogs/vlogs and share our knowledge with everyone.

## Rules to follow
* Fork the repo and clone it.
* It's up to you how you wanna start and proceed. Don't worry about your progress. If you get confused, Start with Day1 question.
* Folder of your name is under src.main.java package. Try to keep your work inside your folder.
* Try not to use @Test annotation in src.main.java package
* Only use dependencies that are necessary and try to keep the POM file lean as much as you can :)
* Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AskAkshat) if you can. I regularly share valuable keynotes for beginners and my insights on Java and programming concepts. The account is only used for knowledge sharing and technical development only.

I also recommend you to follow [Wetesterr](https://twitter.com/wetesterr)

## IDE & Java to use:
I recommed using Idea IntelliJ and latest Java JDK

## Best Practice with GIT
* Always create a new branch and raise Pull Requests to merger it to main branch.
* Do not forget to pull from main branch before you start coding and before raising Pull Requests.

I case of any help, please drop me a message wherever you think is possible to reach me quicker!!


I hope you are good to go now. Lets do it :)

Happy coding!
