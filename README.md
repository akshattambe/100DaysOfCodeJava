# 100DaysOfCodeJava
Learning Java for 100 Days. Thats untill 31st Dec 2020. I with [Wetesterr](https://github.com/WETESTERR) started this series on Twitter on October 3rd.

It's not about learning all of the Java in 100 days :)

We together are going to look at some common and uncommon concepts of Java and brush it up thoroughly. We will code, ready books/blogs/vlogs and share our knowledge with everyone.

## Rules to follow
* Fork the repo and clone it.
* It's up to you how you wanna start and proceed. Don't worry about your progress. If you get confused, Start with Day1 question.
* Folder of your name is under src.main.java package. Try to keep your work inside your folder.
* Try not to use @Test annotation in src.main.java package
* Only use dependencies that are necessary and try to keep the POM file lean as much as you can :)
* Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AskAkshat) if you can. I regularly share valuable keynotes for beginners and my insights on Java and programming concepts. The account only for knowledge sharing and technical development.

I also recommend you to follow [Wetesterr](https://twitter.com/wetesterr)

## IDE & Java to use:
I recommend using Idea IntelliJ and latest Java JDK

## Best Practice with GIT
* Always create a new branch and raise Pull Requests to merge it to the main branch.
* Do not forget to pull from main branch before you start coding and before raising Pull Requests.

## Motto and Feedback
I believe in open learning and sharing ideas/thoughts fearlessly. And I expect the same from you. I hope that you will be able to provide your valuable feedback openly on platforms like [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshat-kumar-tambe-21894323). In the past, I have mentored people who want and get help for free but scared of acknowledging the effort I made. So, frankly speaking, guys, if you think you cannot recognise the efforts anytime in these 100 days of our journey then we are not meant to go this way together :)

In case of any help, please drop me a message on Tweeter/Fb-messenger.


I hope you are good to go now. Lets do it :)


Happy coding!
