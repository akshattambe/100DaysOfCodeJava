     * Conclusion:
     * 1. Static methods are used to perform an operation that are independent of class instances.

     * 3. To access/change static variables and other static methods that don't depend upon objects.
     * 4. static methods in Java are resolved at compile time.
     * 5. static methods cannot access instance variables and instance methods directly; they need some object reference to do so
